PESTO,Photosynthesis Experiment (PESTO),Wheat,Investigate how microgravity affects photosynthesis and leaf development in wheat,2001,"The PESTO experiment examined the effect of microgravity on wheat plants. Researchers found that microgravity altered leaf development and chloroplast structure but did not harm the plants overall; in fact, wheat plants grew about 10% taller compared to those on Earth",【563166519522584†L429-L433】
SEEDLING-GROWTH,Seedling Growth Investigations,Arabidopsis seedlings,Study how seedling gene expression responds to microgravity and different light conditions,2014,Seedling Growth investigations demonstrated that seedlings can acclimate to microgravity by modulating expression of genes related to the stressors of space. These results provide insights into how microgravity affects plant physiology and gene regulation,【286597328345854†L376-L379】
PLANT-GRAVITY-SENSING,Plant Gravity Sensing,Plants (various species),Measure how microgravity affects calcium signalling in plants,2015,"The Plant Gravity Sensing investigation, led by JAXA, measured how microgravity affects calcium levels within plant cells. Understanding gravity sensing at the cellular level could help scientists design better ways to grow food in space",【563166519522584†L445-L448】
ADVASC,Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC),Mustard plants,Evaluate plant growth and seed production across generations in microgravity,2003,The ADVASC experiment grew two generations of mustard plants using the Advanced Astroculture chamber. It showed that seeds grown in space were smaller but germination rates were near normal in microgravity,【563166519522584†L450-L452】
XROOTS,eXposed Root On‑Orbit Test System (XROOTS),Various plants,Demonstrate soil‑free hydroponic and aeroponic plant‑growth techniques,2022,"The XROOTS technology demonstration uses hydroponic and aeroponic techniques to grow plants without soil or other growth media. The experiment evaluates multiple independent growth chambers from seed germination through maturity, providing video and still images to assess plant development. Results could identify suitable methods for large‑scale crop production in future space missions",【383822318840390†L350-L369】
VEGGIE-PONDS,Veggie & Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS),Mizuna mustard; Tomatoes,Test plant growth in the Veggie chamber and evaluate water/nutrient delivery systems,2018,"NASA’s Veggie facility uses seed‑filled fabric pillows to grow plants on the space station. The Passive Orbital Nutrient Delivery System (PONDS) replaces the seed pillows with holders that contain a small water reservoir. Experiments like Veg‑04A and Veg‑04B grew Mizuna mustard and Veg‑05 grew tomatoes under different light conditions to compare yield, nutritional composition and microbial levels to Earth‑grown plants. Crew members also rated the flavour, texture and other characteristics of the crops",【563166519522584†L372-L378】【563166519522584†L405-L409】
VEG-03,Veg‑03,Pak Choi; Lettuce varieties,Grow and transplant multiple crops in the Veggie facility,2016,"During the Veg‑03 investigation, the crew cultivated Extra Dwarf Pak Choi, Outredgeous lettuce and Dragoon lettuce. Astronaut Mike Hopkins performed the first plant transplant in space by moving extra sprouts from thriving plant pillows into struggling pillows. The transplanted plants survived and grew, demonstrating new possibilities for plant cultivation in microgravity",【563166519522584†L471-L478】
VEG-05,Veg‑05,Dwarf tomatoes,Examine how light quality and fertilizer affect fruit production and taste,2023,"The Veg‑05 investigation aims to develop larger growth systems for future space missions. It examines how light quality and fertilizer affect fruit production, nutritional value, safety and taste of dwarf tomato plants",【286597328345854†L399-L403】
PH-04,Plant Habitat‑04,Chile peppers (NuMex “Española Improved”),"Grow chile peppers in space and study flavour, nutrition and plant‑microbe interactions",2021,"NASA’s Plant Habitat‑04 experiment cultivated chile peppers aboard the International Space Station for the first time. The experiment analysed plant–microbe interactions and assessed the flavour and texture of the peppers, with crew members tasting them and sending a portion back to Earth for analysis",【328753064276037†L500-L504】【563166519522584†L405-L416】
PH-03,Plant Habitat‑03,Arabidopsis thaliana,Examine whether epigenetic adaptations in plants grown in space transfer to subsequent generations,2020,Plant Habitat‑03 investigates whether adaptations acquired by plants during spaceflight can be passed to the next generation. It focuses on epigenetic changes—alterations in gene expression without changes to DNA sequence—and aims to understand how these adaptations may produce plants better suited to space and to marginal or reclaimed habitats on Earth,【563166519522584†L482-L503】
