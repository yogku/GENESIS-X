"""Top-level package for the Space Biology Knowledge Engine.

This file marks the directory as a Python package so that relative imports
work correctly when the application is executed as a module (e.g., with
``uvicorn space_biology_app.app:app``). Without an ``__init__.py`` file,
Python treats ``space_biology_app`` as a namespace package, which can
sometimes lead to import errors when using relative imports. Keeping this
file empty is sufficient.
